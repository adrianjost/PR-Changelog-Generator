### Added

- pull request templated for easier and faster PR creation.
- documentation that you also need to setup the sender repository
- documentation of \`token\` input
- new output \`pull_requests\` added, which holds a list of pull request numbers that where included in the release

### Changed

- renamed \`gh-token\` input to \`token\`

### Removed

- MongoDB is no longer required. Therefore the following inputs where removed
  - \`mongo-uri\`
  - \`mongo-db\`
  - \`mongo-collection\`

### Fixed

- action was not starting because of a wrong require name in \`modules\\\\get-pull_request-merges-between-commits.js\`. Changes \`./repo-context\` to \`./context\`
- an import was missing
